# fedleo.py

## Overview

The fedleo.py file implements the FedLEO algorithm, a synchronous federated learning approach tailored for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. It accounts for satellite visibility windows and communication constraints, simulating a realistic scenario where satellites communicate model updates via inter-satellite links (ISL) and ground stations (GS). The algorithm aggregates model weights within orbital clusters before performing global aggregation, and it tracks energy consumption and training time.

## Key Components and Functionality

### 1. Constants and Configuration

**Purpose:** Define parameters for satellite orbits and energy model.

**Constants:**
- `P = 5800` seconds: Orbital period for a 600 km altitude satellite.
- `D = 600` seconds: Duration of visibility with ground stations.
- `N_ORBITS = 5`: Number of orbital planes.
- `SATS_PER_ORBIT = 8`: Satellites per orbit, totaling `TOTAL_SATELLITES = 40`.
- `T_TRAIN = 300` seconds: Local training time per round (5 minutes) [1], a fixed estimate.
- `ENERGY_ISL = 1.0`: Relative energy cost of inter-satellite communication.
- `ENERGY_GS = 10.0`: Relative energy cost of ground station communication.

### 1. Orbital Period
Each satellite in each orbit travels at the same speed, ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f40e5e4-8f3b-40cc-b460-0b5328cb2e32)
 and has the same orbital period, ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a00815-b319-4870-ba80-13cd07736239)

where ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c139487-14bb-4a04-b43e-ea59e17f92a3) is the earth radius (6371km), ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1337c0c5-8e73-4cf3-9c55-10df94fb7cba) is geocentric gravitational constant ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fd7f82e-bfd8-45e9-b1bf-58812b499af8) and ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca8d461-11c0-4e16-a4ae-72d67ecf6876) is orbit altitude (600km)



### 3. Phase Offsets (PHI)

Satellites are evenly spaced across their orbital period:

The phase offset is calculated to ensure even distribution of satellites across the orbital period.

### 4. Cluster Definition (`CLUSTER_LIST`)

Satellites are grouped into clusters (one per orbit), each containing `SATS_PER_ORBIT` satellites. Each cluster performs localized aggregation before sending a representative update.

### 5. Next Visibility Calculation (`next_visibility`)

**Purpose:**  
Compute when a satellite will next be visible to a ground station.

**Formula:**

 is the orbital period
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ba548ce-4a72-4ebb-934d-63a9b8fd0eb7)
 is the next visibility time

### 6. Main Training Loop (`federated_learning`)

**Purpose:**  
Runs the FedLEO algorithm over multiple global rounds.

**Key Steps:**

#### Initialization:
- Load global model to device.
- Prepare lists for tracking metrics.

#### Local Training:
- Each client trains using `LocalUpdate`.
- Local weights and losses are collected.

#### Cluster Aggregation:

#### Master Selection and Communication:
- Master node is the one with the **earliest visibility**.
- Aggregation time:

#### Global Aggregation:
Aggregates cluster weights globally:

-Updates the global model with `load_state_dict`.


#### Energy Calculation:

- Final test accuracy is calculated post training.


# Federated Learning Function (federated_learning)

## Purpose
Orchestrates the FedLEO training process, integrating local training, cluster aggregation, visibility-based synchronization, and metric tracking.

## Implementation

### Initialization:
- Moves the global model to the specified device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU).
- Initializes lists to track training loss, accuracy, total time, and energy consumption.

### Per Global Round (for `args.epochs` rounds):

#### Local Training and Cluster Aggregation:
- For each cluster (representing an orbit), trains all satellites using the `LocalUpdate.update_weights` method from `update.py`.
- Aggregates the local weights within each cluster to produce a single set of weights per cluster.
- Stores these cluster weights for further processing.

#### Master Selection and Visibility Timing:
- Selects the master satellite for each cluster, defined as the one with the earliest visibility time after local training ends.
- Determines the visibility times for all master satellites and sets the global aggregation time as the latest of these times.

#### Global Aggregation:
- Combines the weights from all clusters into a single global weight set.
- Updates the global model with these aggregated weights.

#### Energy Consumption:
- Estimates the energy used in the round by accounting for communication costs between all satellites and with ground stations.
- Adds this energy cost to the running total.

#### Metrics Collection:
- Computes the average training loss and accuracy by evaluating the model across all clients using the `LocalUpdate.inference` method.
- Updates the respective tracking lists with these metrics.

#### Logging:
- Prints statistics for the current round, including loss, accuracy, total time, and energy, and provides a final summary after all rounds.

### Final Evaluation:
- Assesses the global modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset using the `test_inference` method from `update.py`.
- Returns the training loss history, training accuracy history, test accuracy, total time, and total energy for further analysis.
